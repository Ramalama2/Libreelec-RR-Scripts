# Libreelec-RR-Scripts
Some scripts that will probably help with Libreelec

The only script right now, is a small Libreelec-RR Compile helper.
The main reason for this script, is simply to download, execute it and get a finally ready to update build for Libreelec-RR (with included xow support)

As xow can't be included in any final build, that is ready to install, this is the only way to go.


What you need / Instructions:
- Any linux distribution: Ubuntu/Debian/Mint Recommended
- wget https://github.com/Ramalama2/Libreelec-RR-Scripts/raw/main/libreelec-rr.sh
- chmod +x libreelec-rr.sh
- Edit the options inside the script
- ./libreelec-rr.sh

- Dependencies will be shown by the script and handled via the Libreelec-RR project.
--- Means: You get told what's missing or the scripts will install needed Dependencies.

- The final builds are inside the git folder, in the "target" directory!


If you have any ideas/issues, feel free to open a ticket.

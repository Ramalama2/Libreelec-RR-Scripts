# Libreelec-RR-Scripts
Some scripts that will probably help with Libreelec

Here isn't much atm and nothing is really usable, just have a bit pation.

The only script right now, is a small Libreelec-RR Compile helper.
The main reason for this script, is simply to download, execute it and get a finally ready to update build for Libreelec-RR (with included xow support)

As xow can't be included in any final build, that is ready to install, this is the only way to go.
